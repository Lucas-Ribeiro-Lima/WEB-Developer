                    Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series.
                    He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world.
                    Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six
                    Eyes in four hundred years.
                    He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong
                    young allies.

                <h2 class="titulo">Appearance</h2>
                <p class="descricao">
                    Satoru is a very tall, lean and muscular man who is in his late twenties and is considered
                    relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features.
                    He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his
                    eyes with a black blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance.
                    When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the
                    base of his neck.<br><br>
                    While working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high collar that's also fairly wide. He
                    wears slim-fit matching black pants and black dress boots. Before switching over to a simple
                    blindfold,
                    Satoru used to wear bandages over his eyes. Satoru enjoys wearing expensive clothing and has a
                    number of casual looks he'll pair with wearing his sunglasses.
                    As a Tokyo Jujutsu High student, Satoru wore the normal school uniform with his sunglasses before
                    adopting any sort of makeshift blindfold.

                <p class="descricao">
                    According to legend, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon (仮か想そうの鬼き神じん Kasō no Kijin?)
                    during the Heian Era but in truth he was a sorcerer also known as the Disgraced One (堕だ天てん
                    Daten?).<br>
                    Jujutsu sorcerers of the Golden Age of Jujutsu gave their all against him but ultimately fell one
                    after another.
                    Sukuna existed throughout the ages by transforming into a cursed object after death, a state where
                    he split his power into twenty indestructible fingers.
                    Sukuna was incarnated in June 2018 when Yuji Itadori consumed one of his fingers.
                    Sukuna was trapped inside Yuji's body and was rarely in control until he managed to transfer his
                    soul into the body of Megumi Fushiguro.
                </p>

                <p class="descricao">
                    His past appearance is described as a demon with four arms and two faces.[1] Previously, he used to
                    take the appearance of his former host: Yuji Itadori,
                    but with pink spiked hair slightly pushed upfront and with tattoos/lines on his forehead, nose,
                    cheeks, upper body, and abdomen. He also has a second pair of eyes underneath his normal eyes,
                    which are usually closed.<br>
                    Now, he takes the appearance of his new current host: Megumi Fushiguro, but with uniquely styled
                    black hair with long spikes that jut out in every direction around his head,
                    resembling a sea-urchin and with tattoos/lines on his forehead, nose, cheeks, upper body, and
                    abdomen. He also has a second pair of eyes underneath his normal eyes.
                    Sukuna also has two lines on both his wrists, upper arms, circles on both his shoulders with a dot
                    in each, two-segmented curve lines on his chest, and two lines on his stomach while possessing
                    Yuji/Megumi.<br>
                    Sukuna wears a light-colored kimono with a black edge, a black scarf, and black shoes.

                    Yuji Itadori (虎いた杖どり悠ゆう仁じ Itadori Yūji?) is the main protagonist of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is
                    the son of Jin Itadori and Kaori Itadori.
                    Yuji is the grandson of Wasuke Itadori who was living a normal life until he encountered Megumi and
                    ate one of Sukuna's fingers. After becoming Sukuna's
                    vessel, Yuji began attending Tokyo Jujutsu High alongside Megumi and Nobara as first-year students.
                </p>
                <h2 class="titulo">Appearance</h2>
                <p class="descricao">
                    Yuji is a young man of average height and appears to have a slender build when wearing baggy
                    clothing, but actually has a lean and muscular physique.
                    He also has relatively large light brown eyes and spiky pink hair (brownish blonde in the manga)
                    that's styled in an undercut fashion. When becoming the
                    vessel for Sukuna after eating his finger, he gains a second pair of eyes that only open when Sukuna
                    controls his body along with his many markings.<br><br>

                    At the start of the series, Yuji wore a light-colored hooded jacket, high-cuffed black pants, and
                    white shoes. However, in the anime,
                    his pants were denim, and his shoes were bright red. When Yuji enrolled into the Tokyo Metropolitan
                    Curse Technical College,
                    he began wearing his version of the uniform; a black long sleeve shirt resembling a gakuran over a
                    red hoodie, black pants, and red shoes.<br><br>

                    He gains a noticeable scar between his two eyes and a smaller scar on his left labial commissure of
                    the mouth during the Shibuya Incident.<br><br>

                    He lost the second pair of eyes that only open when Sukuna controls his body along with his many
                    markings after the latter transferred to Megumi Fushiguro as his new vessel.

                    He is a grade 2 jujutsu sorcerer and first-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High alongside Yuji Itadori

                    descendant of the Zenin Family.
                    Megumi was born outside the clan as Toji's trump card and was eventually found by Satoru Gojo, who
                    mentored him and enrolled him at
                    Jujutsu High as his student.

                    white dress shirt. His uniform pants match his jacket and only reach to just above his shins. He
                    wears long black socks that cover his exposed ankles and finishes his outfit with low-top brown
                    shoes. He also has a blue tracksuit for training.<br><br>
                    In middle school, Megumi wore the Saitama Urami East Junior High uniform, which consisted of a tan
                    jacket over a white dress shirt with black pants and white sneakers. While sneaking inside the
                    Gachinko Fight Club, Megumi wore a black hoodie and matching pants with his normal shoes as a

                    series and the main protagonist of its prequel series, Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Jujutsu High.
                    He was initially a special grade cursed human haunted by his late childhood friend, Rika Orimoto.
                    Satoru Gojo mentored Yuta and enrolled him at Tokyo Jujutsu High.
                    Yuta is currently a second-year student at Jujutsu High where he works as a jujutsu sorcerer.
                    He was training overseas in Africa with Miguel until after the Shibuya Incident when he returned to

                    first-year, Yuta's body language made it obvious that he was under a lot of stress.
                    His posture was very unconfident, and he still has dark circles under his eyelids from a lack of
                    sleep. As a second-year student,
                    Yuta's hair has grown longer and he wears it in a more relaxed style instead of a spiky one.<br><br>

                    At his old school, Yuta wore a suit for their uniform. He sported a long-sleeve shirt that stops at
                    his forearms or a black t-shirt and dark green pants for casual wear.
                    After transferring to Tokyo Jujutsu High, Yuta received a specialized uniform. Yuta has a loose
                    white uniform jacket with sleeves that stop at his forearms.
                    He also wears slender blue jeans that tuck into white sneakers that match his jacket. Yuta also
